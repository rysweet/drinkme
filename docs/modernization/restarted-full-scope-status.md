# Restarted full-scope Alice modernization status

Last updated: 2026-05-04

## Campaign state

- Loop 64 recovery/integration is **closed**.
- The recovered source and support-tool work that passed review was integrated.
- The restarted modernization wave integrated Alice PRs #35, #36, #37, #38, #39, #40, #42, #43, #44, #45, and #46; drinkme PR #4; and eatme PR #6.
- Artifact-only lanes were preserved in `drinkme`; they are not Alice runtime/source changes.
- The original full-scope Alice modernization remains **open**. Do not treat Loop 64 recovery closure as modernization completion.

## Active workstreams

| Workstream | Owner repo | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Alice source modernization | `rysweet/alice3-modernization` | Open: continue characterization-first source work behind local gates and CI. |
| Eatme real-Alice user QA | `rysweet/eatme` | Open: continue lesson/persona/scenario smoke coverage against real Alice evidence. |
| Supporting-tool readiness | `gadugi-agentic-test` and related tooling | Open as needed: fix harness/tool defects only when they block evidence-producing Alice or eatme work. |
| Code-atlas / formal-spec / crusty review inputs | `rysweet/drinkme` | Open read-only inputs: use recovered findings to choose and review high-value seams. |
| Drinkme status and artifact reconciliation | `rysweet/drinkme` | Open: keep issue/status artifacts current as each work round changes state. |

## Latest integrated evidence

- Coverage tooling now exists through a reporting-only JaCoCo profile and CI artifact baseline.
- Project IO/load-save has new archive fixture, backup, save-to-backup, cancellation, and JSON/XML manifest fallback characterization.
- Outside-in Alice desktop QA scenarios now cover open/load/save, package/install smoke, and wizard/palette/completion contracts at the scenario level.
- NetBeans export coverage now uses a populated `Alice3Library` classpath contract with JavaFX artifacts and install/package smoke assertions.
- Generated Story API Java coverage now includes loop, foreach, iterable, local, method, parameter, conditional, and story API call compile characterization; stale cached `COUNT__` foreach item names are repaired while explicit item names are preserved.
- Starter project `.a3p` archives now have XML fallback readability coverage using committed fixtures.
- Croquet palette layout and scenegraph model behavior have new headless characterization tests; scenegraph `Joint` bounds/scale bugs exposed by tests were fixed.
- Public no-Sims builds now guard against nonfree library leakage, and includeSims builds explicitly overwrite the no-Sims `Alice3Library.xml` when authorized.
- Eatme now has expanded instructor/student prompt assets, Alice.org-grounded lesson smoke scenarios, gadugi adapters, and split validation modules below the 500-line target.
- Formal high-risk data-loss Gherkin scenarios are recorded in drinkme as specified behavior, with implementation status separated from completion claims.

## No-premature-completion rule

Do not mark the Alice modernization complete while any of these remain true:

1. active workstreams above are still open;
2. characterization coverage is still below the modernization target;
3. real UI/story/export/load-save journeys remain unproven;
4. local gates or GitHub Actions have not passed for the integrated source state;
5. `drinkme` has not recorded the evidence, limits, and next work.

Closure requires evidence, not a recovered artifact count or a single successful loop.
